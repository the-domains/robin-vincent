description: "Robin Vincent is a musician, writer and veteran of the computer music industry. Back in the 1990â€™s he ran the PC Product department at Turnkey, released a couple of books on the subject and helped design the Carillon AC-1 audio PC and bring it to market. From 2006 he ran the UK operation of audio PC manufacturer Rain Computers and in 2013 he formed Molten Music Technology to continue building audio PCs under his own steam. This independence enabled him to team up with former Carillon colleague Neil Hester to create The Pro Tools PC, the only computer designed, built and supported exclusively for the use of Pro Tools. For a few years now he's been running a YouTube channel offering advice, reviews and information on computer music technology, and occasionally he writes for Sound On Sound magazine. His latest side project is focusing on the musical capabilities of the Microsoft Surface platform. He lives with his wife and three young kids in the wilds of Norfolk where he likes to create meditative music and produce electronic soundscapes for cathedrals."
